# Contributing

The current model has mostly been tested on high-range float32 images (images with a lot of information), so there may be other images or formats where the model is not able to align the input images perfectly.

## Finding images where the model is not able to align them

The simplest way to contribute to this project is by finding images that cannot be properly aligned with the align() or fast_align() functions. If that happens, please do not immediately flee to the next repository and take the time to let me know.

## Code optimization

The code could be optimized by implementing more functions or objects in such a way that they perform the same tasks using fewer lines of code.

## Suggesting new functionalities

If you have ideas for this library then It would be awesome to hear from you. Any ideas & suggestions are welcomed.
