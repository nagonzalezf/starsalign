"""
StarsAlign
==========

A tool for aligning and comparing astronomical images.

Specially developed to work over float32 high density images with a large range, typically found in astronomical imaging.

This package contains functions such as ```align()``` and ```diff()``` that aligns and compute the difference of two multi channel images using SIFT algorithm and FLANN based matcher.

You can also try functions ```fast_align()``` and ```fast_diff()``` for single channel images, this method is faster but it may be less accurate for lower resolution images.

Example:
===
    >>> import starsalign as sa
    >>> aligned_image = sa.align(ref_image, science_image)
    >>> diff_image = sa.diff(ref_image, science_image)

Important:
===
This package was specifically designed to work with images that have a high amount of information, such as 4096x2048 pixels, with float32 data type, and a range of values between -155.45811 and 43314.49.

If your images have a high density of information, then the fast_align() and fast_diff() functions should work well. However, if you are working with images of lower resolution or lower information density, it is recommended to use the align() and diff() functions.

The align() and diff() functions are slower, but supports multi channel images and performs calculations using more information wich results in extreme precision, but it may require more resources.

Warning: Using the align() and diff() functions on high-density information and high-resolution images may result in prolonged waiting times.
